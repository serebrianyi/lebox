# leboX

leboX is a new way to enhance the performance of your portfolio with your dormant shares. What does it mean? The keyword is "Securities Lending and Borrowing" (SLB).

These days SLB is a business for institutional clients only. There is no centralised exchange for SLB. That means it is a "over the counter" business only. An average person has no chance to pull the benefits from this service.

Why institutional clients do SLB?
* 1. Short Selling
* 2. Hedging their positions
* 3. Arbitrage Trading

The new solution is "leboX".
leboX is a centralised exchange for SLB which can be accessed by any bank worldwide. Thus everyone (average person or institutional client) can use leboX for SLB. Mainly the average person can lend securities and institutional client can lend and borrow securities.

Competitive advantages:
* 1. leboX is the first exchange for SLB worldwide.
* 2. Competitive prices / fees
* 3. Private trader (average person) is more encourage to trade securities
